# Championship
In a championship league, n (max 20) teams play for m (max 20) days. The points gained from each match are stored a matrix of n Ã— m integers, each of which can only be either 0, 1 or 3. Each i-th row of the matrix represents the points gained by the i-th team in the m days of the championship league. Each j-th column of the matrix represents the points gained by the n teams in the matches of the j-th day. The points acquired are 3 for a won game, 1 for tied and 0 for a defeat, respectively. 

The code calculates each days score table and prints the leader of each day. If there are more than one winner, it only prints the first in the order.
